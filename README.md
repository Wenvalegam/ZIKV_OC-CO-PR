The following repository has been created to reproduce the numerical results in Valega-Mackenzie et. al, 2023. 
## Optimal Control Applied to Zika Virus Epidemics in Colombia and Puerto Rico (2023) 

The folder Optimal_Control contains the MATLAB files to reproduce the numerical simulations for Colombia and Puerto Rico in the numerical simulation section of the paper. The (/../ZIKV_OC-CO-PR/Optimal_Control/ode45zikaOC.m) file contains the Forward Backward Sweep method which needs the state system [Optimal_Control/zikastates.m] and adjoint system for $J_1$ and $J_2$ in.
